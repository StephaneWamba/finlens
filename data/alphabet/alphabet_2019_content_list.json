Our investments in Google and Other Bets span a wide range of industries. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from our advertising and related business, use of alternative investment, governance or compensation structures, the fact that such offerings or strategies may not be commercially viable for an indefinite amount of time or at all, or may not result in adequate return of capital on our investments; and unidentified issues may not be discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potentia merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of th Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.   \nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.   \nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.   \nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.   \nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.   \nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.

We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. ",

Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors.

The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. The IRS served a Notice of Appeal on February 22, 2016 and the case is being heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Tax Court’s decision in an opinion issued on July 24, 2018, but withdrew that opinion in an order issued on August 7, 2018 to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer on the appeal. At this time, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has not issued a final decision, and the U.S. Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stockbased compensation from its regulations. We have evaluated the opinion and continue to record a tax benefit related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. In accordance with the Tax Act, the Altera tax benefit was remeasured from 35% to 21%. We also remeasured the tax benefit expected to be realized upon settlement including the expected future new taxes enacted by the Tax Act due upon resolution of the matter. The tax liability recorded as of December 31, 2016 for the U.S. tax cost of the potential repatriation associated with the contingent foreign earnings was reversed due to the Tax Act introducing a territorial tax system and providing a 100% dividend received deduction on certain qualified dividends from foreign subsidiaries.
