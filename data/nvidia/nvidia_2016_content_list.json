We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share. ",

Once construction is complete, the lease balance will remain static at the completed cost for the remaining duration of the lease term. During construction, accrued interest will be capitalized into the lease balance. Following construction, we will pay rent in the form of interest. The lease has an initial 7.5 year term expiring on December 19, 2022, consisting of an approximately 2.5 year construction period followed by a 5 year lease term. We have the option to renew this lease for up to three additional 5 year periods, subject to approval by the banks. During the term of the lease, we may elect to purchase the headquarters building for the amount of the banks’ investment in the building and any accrued but unpaid rent. At the end of the lease term, we may elect to buy the building for the outstanding balance on the maturity date or arrange for the cash sale of the building to an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate guarantee made by us under the lease is no more than 87.5% of the costs incurred in connection with the construction of the building.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. ",

For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors.

If a software license is included, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If a software license is not included, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The update is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Companies can elect to adopt the standard update prospectively or retrospectively to arrangements entered into, or materially modified, after the effective date. The update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2017. We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in software license assets and related depreciation expense, and a corresponding decrease in prepaid service contract assets and related service contract expense in our consolidated financial statements.

On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year, such that the new standard will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The FASB will also permit entities to adopt the standard one year earlier if they choose (i.e., the original effective date). We will adopt this guidance either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined which transition method we will apply. ",

On October 6, 2014, the ITC instituted an investigation of NVIDIA’s claim. In June 2015, NVIDIA moved to terminate all asserted claims on four patents and these motions were granted. The ITC held an evidentiary hearing on certain asserted claims of the three remaining patents from June 22 through June 26, 2015. On October 9, 2015, the ITC Administrative Law Judge, or ALJ, rendered an initial determination that importation of the Samsung Accused Products did not violate U.S. law. NVIDIA petitioned for review of the ALJ’s determination and Samsung and Qualcomm filed contingent petitions for review of the ALJ’s determination. On December 14, 2015, the ITC decided not to review the ALJ’s determination and terminated the Investigation. On February 11, 2016, NVIDIA petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to review the ITC’s decision not to review the ALJ’s determination.

Samsung amended its complaint twice, first on December 19, 2014, and then on April 10, 2015, without changing its legal claims.

On April 24, 2015, Samsung moved to sever NVIDIA’s counter-claims for patent infringement and its motion was granted on May 19, 2015. NVIDIA voluntarily withdrew its counter-claims on May 19, 2015.

Samsung’s false advertising claim was dismissed with prejudice on July 30, 2015. On October 15, 2015, NVIDIA’s Motion for Entry of Judgment of Noninfringement was granted as to one of Samsung’s patents. On January 6, 2016, the Court dismissed plaintiff Samsung Electronics America, Inc. due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  On January 20, 2016, the Court dismissed with prejudice defendants Old Micro, Inc. and Velocity Holdings, LLC. On January 26, 2016, the Court dismissed with prejudice Samsung’s infringement claims as to one of the four remaining patents. Beginning January 26, 2016, a jury trial was held regarding Samsung’s patent infringement claims as to the three remaining patents. On February 1, 2016, the Court declared a mistrial as to two of the three remaining patents as a sanction based on Samsung’s failure to comply with its obligation to produce all materials its experts relied on in forming the experts’ opinions in the case. The trial continued as to the last patent. On February 5, 2016, the jury returned a verdict of non-infringement of that patent, that one of the four claims of that patent was invalid, and that Samsung was not entitled to any damages. The re-trial of Samsung’s infringement claims on the two remaining patents is scheduled to begin May 4, 2016. ",

On December 23, 2014, the ITC instituted an investigation of Samsung’s claims. On June 5, 2015, Samsung withdrew one patent from the case. A hearing on Samsung’s three remaining patents was held from August 18 through August 21, 2015. On December 22, 2015, the ALJ issued an Initial Determination, or ID, finding that NVIDIA and the other Respondents infringed the asserted claims of the three remaining asserted patents and had violated Section 337. On January 4, 2016, NVIDIA and the other Respondents filed a Petition for Review of the ALJ’s ID seeking review and reversal of his findings that the asserted claims were valid and infringed and that Section 337 had been violated. On January 4, 2016, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations also filed a Petition for Review of the ALJ’s ID seeking review and reversal of his findings that the asserted claims of one of the patents were valid and infringed and that Section 337 had been violated as to that patent. On February 24, 2016, the ITC determined to review in part the ALJ’s ID and asked for further briefing from the parties as to certain issues and patents. As the ITC did not seek to review the findings of infringement and validity of all three patents, the ITC may issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order under one or more of the patents. The innovations claimed in these patents are minor and insignificant to the performance of our products. Based on our plans to modify certain impacted products and certain distribution operations in the United States, we do not believe that the possible entry of these orders will have a significant impact to our business. The target date for the final determination by the ITC is April 25, 2016, followed by the Presidential Review Period ending June 24, 2016. ",
