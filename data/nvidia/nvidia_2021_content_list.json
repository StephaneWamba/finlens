The announced acquisition is expected to bring together NVIDIA's leading AI computing platform with Arm's vast ecosystem to create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation while expanding into large, high-growth markets. We paid \\$2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition \\$10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of \\$21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional \\$5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to \\$1.5   billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The \\$2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of \\$1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of \\$0.17 billion and royalties of \\$0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded \\$1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The \\$2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. ",

This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.

These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.

We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business.

Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.

Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.

We paid \\$2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition \\$10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of \\$21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional \\$5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to \\$1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The \\$2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of \\$1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of \\$0.17 billion and royalties of \\$0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded \\$1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The \\$2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. ",

In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. ",

Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past performance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts.

The \\$2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of \\$1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of \\$0.17 billion and royalties of \\$0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions.
