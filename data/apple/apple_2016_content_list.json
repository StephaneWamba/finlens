The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form $_ { 1 0 - 1 }$ under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.

The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to $\\tt t 1 3$ billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes. ",

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes. ",

The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 24, 2016, approximately 386.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan. ",
