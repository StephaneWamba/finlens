A duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide \"false\" accounts into two categories: (1) usermisclassifi ed accounts, where users have created personal profi les for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profi le under our terms of service); and (2) undesirable accounts, which represent user profi les that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, such as spamming. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply signifi cant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar IP addresses or user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very diffi cult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary signifi cantly from our estimates. ",

Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specifi c countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam.

Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were fi led in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and offi cers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecifi ed damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), SEC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modifi ed consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which is pending federal court approval, and we also entered into a fi nal settlement to resolve the SEC inquiry. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC requires us to pay a penalty of \\$5.0 billion and to signifi cantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight.

While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have fi led a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in February 2020. In October 2019, the IRS fi led its Statement of Position in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The IRS did not provide a specifi c amount for the adjustment nor any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the limited information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately \\$9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally fi led U.S. return, which is an increase from our previous estimate of up to \\$5.0 billion, plus interest and any penalties asserted. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately \\$680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally fi led U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have fi led a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefi t consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Statement of Position. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially off set by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of September 30, 2019, we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court. ",

Revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users aff ects our revenue and fi nancial results because we currently monetize users in diff erent geographies at diff erent average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets.

While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have fi led a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case is scheduled for trial beginning in February 2020. In October 2019, the IRS fi led its Statement of Position in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The IRS did not provide a specifi c amount for the adjustment nor any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years. Based on the limited information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately \\$9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally fi led U.S. return, which is an increase from our previous estimate of up to \\$5.0 billion, plus interest and any penalties asserted. In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately \\$680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally fi led U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the second Notice and have fi led a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefi t consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Statement of Position. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially off set by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).

Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were fi led in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and offi cers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecifi ed damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions.

Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC requires us to pay a penalty of \\$5.0 billion and to signifi cantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight.

Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the eff ectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely aff ect the usage of Facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and we expect that any similar changes to its or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the eff ectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers and browser developers.

Our brands may also be negatively aff ected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual eff orts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, or by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the 2020 U.S. presidential election or other elections around the world. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data, have eroded confi dence in our brands, and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this eff ort, our business and fi nancial results may be adversely aff ected.

Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information from marketers, could result in the loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future.

Our eff orts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks.

From time to time, we make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period.
