Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not refl ect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifi er or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require signifi cant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very diffi cult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary signifi cantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends. ",

Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC, U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the FTC fi led a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia fi led a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints fi led by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general fi led a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and on April 27, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affi rmed the lower court's order dismissing the attorneys general's complaint. The attorneys general did not fi le a petition for certiorari by the deadline of July 26, 2023. On August 19, 2021, the FTC fi led an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we fi led a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been fi led in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a fi rst amended consolidated complaint was fi led in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the fi rst amended consolidated complaint fi led in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.

As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to eff ectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and are engaging with regulators on our proposed consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.

While we saw improvement in business and macroeconomic conditions in the third quarter of 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our fi nancial results in future periods.

In response to competitive pressures, we are investing in Reels and in AI initiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content, which we have already seen results in improved user engagement and monetization of our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fl uctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time.

Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require signifi cant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products.

The decreases in average price per ad were driven by increases in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. While the average price per ad declined, we believe the improvements to our ad targeting and measurement tools have had a favorable impact on our ad performance and advertising demand. Other factors are also discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Third Quarter Results.\" In addition, year-over-year advertising revenue growth was driven mainly by marketer spending in online commerce, consumer packaged goods, and gaming while online commerce and gaming benefi ted from marketers based in China. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered. ",

With respect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of \\$725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modifi ed consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took eff ect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of \\$5.0 billion and to signifi cantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fi nes and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely aff ect our business. We believe the ongoing lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was fi led in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and offi cers asserting breach of fi duciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders fi led an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fi duciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and offi cers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiff s fi led a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. On January 19, 2022, we fi led a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023.

Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the FTC, U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the FTC fi led a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia fi led a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints fi led by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general fi led a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and on April 27, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affi rmed the lower court's order dismissing the attorneys general's complaint. The attorneys general did not fi le a petition for certiorari by the deadline of July 26, 2023. On August 19, 2021, the FTC fi led an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we fi led a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been fi led in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a fi rst amended consolidated complaint was fi led in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the fi rst amended consolidated complaint fi led in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules.

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to increases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at diff erent points during the pandemic.

In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these eff orts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we expect will continue to monetize at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products for the foreseeable future. These decisions may adversely aff ect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefi ts that we expect. ",

We may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively aff ect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisers may aff ect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products.

For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are illegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce our policies, address objectionable content or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confi dence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively aff ected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual eff orts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around geopolitical events or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service.

        "text": "Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not refl ect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifi er or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques and models require signifi cant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very diffi cult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary signifi cantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends. ",

        "text": "To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply signifi cant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may aff ect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from diff erent products, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users.

Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland’s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fi ne of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage, of such data in the United States.

On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the “Data Privacy Framework List,” maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. Although the implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome milestones, we continue to engage with the IDPC to understand their impact on the above corrective orders and what, if any, remaining potential impact there may be to our operations.

Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely aff ected, and may in the future adversely aff ect, our advertising business.

The DSA also includes signifi cant penalties for non-compliance.

For example, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. The potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which most member states have already implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online videosharing platforms, which member states are implementing. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various other litigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive eff orts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur signifi cant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, signifi cant damages. We could also face fi nes, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fi nes or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacifi c, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially signifi cant penalties, including fi nes, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fi nes and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to fi nes and service blocking and prohibition in Russia.
