The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply signifi cant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar IP addresses or user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. As such, our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts. In particular, duplicate accounts are very diffi cult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate accounts may vary signifi cantly from our estimates. ",

We believe the increase in this estimate from our prior estimate of duplicate accounts is primarily due to implementation of this new methodology. We also believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as compared to more developed markets. In the third quarter of 2017, we estimate that user-misclassifi ed and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 2-3% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we observed in the third quarter of 2017 and which we have seen originate more frequently in specifi c countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam.

For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. Our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also aff ected by these factors. For example, in late 2015, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography. While this issue did not aff ect our overall worldwide revenue, it did aff ect our attribution of revenue to diff erent geographic regions. The fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and ARPU amounts were adjusted to refl ect this reclassifi cation. ",

This information is a non-GAAP fi nancial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP fi nancial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, fi nancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be diff erent from non-GAAP fi nancial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the eff ect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual eff ect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP fi nancial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the fi nancial performance of our business, enables comparison of fi nancial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.

In late 2015, we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography. While this issue did not aff ect our overall worldwide revenue, it did aff ect our attribution of revenue to diff erent geographic regions. The fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and ARPU amounts for all regions were adjusted to refl ect this reclassifi cation. ",

The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory; factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on News Feed, partially off set by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Eff ective Date, which delays the eff ective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original eff ective date. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) (ASU 2016-08) which clarifi es the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. The guidance includes indicators to assist an entity in determining whether it controls a specifi ed good or service before it is transferred to the customers. The new standard further requires new disclosures about contracts with customers, including the signifi cant judgments the registrant has made when applying the guidance. We will be adopting the new standard eff ective January 1, 2018. The new standard also permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative eff ect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the modifi ed retrospective method). We currently anticipate adopting the standard using the modifi ed retrospective method. We are in the process of fi nalizing our analysis of the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated fi nancial statements, related disclosures, and our internal controls over fi nancial reporting. We do not expect the impact of adoption to be material. ",

The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also aff ect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our eff ective tax rate. These tax eff ects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could signifi cantly increase our eff ective tax rate and adversely aff ect our fi nancial results.

The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply signifi cant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar IP addresses or user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users.

We believe the increase in this estimate from our prior estimate of duplicate accounts is primarily due to implementation of this new methodology. We also believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as compared to more developed markets. In the third quarter of 2017, we estimate that user-misclassifi ed and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 2-3% of our worldwide MAUs.

Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative eff ect on our fi nancial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires signifi cant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may aff ect our eff ective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may diff er from the amounts recorded in our fi nancial statements and may materially aff ect our fi nancial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely aff ected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. For example, we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an eff ective tax rate that is signifi cantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the United States and this could continue to happen in the future.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially aff ect our fi nancial position and results of operations. Many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could signifi cantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profi t Sharing Project, and issued in 2015, and is expected to continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. In addition, the current U.S. administration, the House Committee on Ways and Means, and the Senate Committee on Finance recently released a framework for U.S. tax reform. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, could aff ect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide eff ective tax rate and harm our fi nancial position and results of operations.
